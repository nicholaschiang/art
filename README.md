# Art Generator

Website that hosts a program that automatically generates graphic art through two
fundamental graph search algorithms, namely the breadth-first search (BFS) and
the depth-first search (DFS). Based off of [Eric Miami's original
project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=jc7NQ3sNN58&feature=emb_logo).

> The idea was that when we first visit a pixel, we color it by calculating the
> average color of the neighboring pixels that have already been colored and by
> adding a small deviation to the average.
